NXLIB build and installation instructions
Version 0.46, February 21, 2010

1. Modify Makefile to set Microwindows and X11 include and lib directories
	MWIN_INCLUDE=/pathto/microwin/src/include
	MWIN_LIB=/pathto/microwin/src/lib
	X11_INCLUDE=/usr/X11R6/include
	or, if X11 not installed on cross-compiling host, use nxlib's X11 headers
	X11_INCLUDE=.

	Microwindows v0.92 or later should be used.

2. Modify Makefile to set X11 PCF and Truetype font search directories
	X11_FONT_DIR1=/usr/share/X11/fonts/100dpi
	X11_FONT_DIR2=/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc
	X11_FONT_DIR3=/usr/share/X11/fonts/TTF

	More fonts directories can be added in font.c

3. Modify Makefile to set X11 fonts and dir and rgb.txt file location
	X11_FONTS=/usr/share/fonts/X11
	X11_RGBTXT=/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt

4. Modify Makefile to enable NXLIB shared library and version if desired
	SHAREDLIB=Y
	LIBNAME=X11
	SOLIBREV=6.2
	CFLAGS += -DXCONST=_Xconst

	Because of X11 hdr version inconstencies, you may need to set 
		CFLAGS += -DXCONST=_Xconst  or  CFLAGS += -DXCONST=
	to compile _Xconst in or out of a couple of function declarations.

5. Type "make".
	This builds the library using your already-installed X11 headers.
	If DEBUG = -g, a larger library will be built with debug information.
	If INCLUDE_XRM=Y, unmodified Xrm database routines will be included.

6. Modify X11 application link lines to use '-lNX11 -lnano-X'.
	Otherwise you will have to install NXLIB as libX11.so.
	Change LIBNAME=X11 above, and then set INSTALL_DIR=<path to X11 libraries>.
	DO NOT "make install" UNTIL YOU BACK UP THE FOLLOWING LIBRARIES.
	NOTE "make install" WILL BY DEFAULT OVERWRITE THE FOLLOWING FILES:

	/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.*
	(/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2)
